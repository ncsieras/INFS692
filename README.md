# Final Project

# Pre-processing of Data
A dataset `radiomics_completed.csv` was imported. This dataset was check for **missing** and **null** values. Also, the dataset was normalized. The normalized dataset called `normalRad.csv` was used for ensemble calssification model, network-based classification model, and clustering techniques. 

# Model 1 Ensemble Classification Model

## Bagging
Bagging is also known as *bootstrap aggregating * prediction models, is a general method for fitting multiple versions of a prediction model 
and then combining (or ensembling) them into an aggregated prediction and is designed to improve the stability and accuracy of regression 
and classification algorithms.

## Random Forest 
Random forest is used for classifying and predicting the binary.failure od the radiomics dataset.

# Model 2 Network-based Classification Model 
A network-based classification model was in classifying the binary.failure.

# Model 3 Cluster Techniques
